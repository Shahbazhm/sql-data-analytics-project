# sql-data-analytics-project
This repository is my go-to collection of SQL scripts for exploring data, running analytics, and building reports. It includes hands-on examples covering database exploration, key metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analysis, segmentation, and other common analytical workflows.

I put these queries together to help analysts and BI professionals quickly dive into relational data, slice it in meaningful ways, and extract insights efficiently. Each script highlights a specific analytical theme and reflects practical SQL patterns and best practices I rely on in real-world work.
